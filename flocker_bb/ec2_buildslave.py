"""
An improved latent or on-demand slave implementation.

Buildbot's latent slave implementation has some issues. It will often get into
a state where where it doesn't try to start a slave. I'm not sure exactly why
this is but it is related to the fact that the state is spread out over 4
objects and 6 classes
- buildbot.buildslave.base.AbstractLatentBuildSlave
  - buildbot.buildslave.base.AbstractBuildSlave
- buildbot.process.slavebuilder.LatentSlaveBuilder
  - buildbot.process.slavebuilder.AbstractSlaveBuilder
- buildbot.process.builder.Builder
- buildbot.process.botmaster.BotMaster

This implements a simpler scheme, which acts like a regular slave, but watches
buildbot's state to start and stop the slave.
- When a build request comes in for a builder the slave is allocated to,
  start this slave.
- Poll for existing requests for builders the slave is allocated to.
  (This catches the case where there are existing requests, and probably
  also the case where a build failed).
- Keep track of the builders using this slave, and stop the slave
  after it has been idle for a specified amount of time.

The starting and stopping of the node is handled in flocker_bb.ec2,
using an explicit state machine.


A few other changes are required to make this work well.

- Since buildbot doesn't know these slaves are latent, it will schedule all
  builds on the first slave to connect. To handle this, we monkeypatch
  ``BotMaster.maybeStartBuildsForSlave`` to wait 10s before starting builds on
  a newly connected slave.
- Only latent slaves receive a ``buildStarted`` call. We monkeypatch
  ``SlaveBuilder.buildStarted`` to call ``buildStarted`` if it exists.
- Since buildbot doesn't know these slaves are latent, the builders page
  doesn't show force build options if no slaves are connected. An updated
  template is included that always shows the force build forms.
